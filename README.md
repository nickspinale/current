# htorrent
A minimalistic, cross-platform BitTorrent client written in Haskell.

Development for this project is currently happening in other components - chunks of functionality modularized into seperate libraries to maximize code re-use. See the following repositories:

* [nickspinale/bigword](http://github.com/nickspinale/bigword): Library for constructing and inspecting bitvectors with statically known size as heterogeneous Church-encoded vectors.
* [nickspinale/becode](http://github.com/nickspinale/bencode): Efficient and flexible parsers and builders for Bencode.
* [nickspinale/aether](http://github.com/nickspinale/aether): Haskell implementation of the Mainline Distributed Hashtable.

No decisions have been made about the frontend yet.
It will most likely be flexible, like [Yi](https://github.com/yi-editor/yi)'s.
