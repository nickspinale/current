mmap(2): System.IO.MMap
still acid?

ip type??
20 byte type?
change from Addr to SockAddr?

---------------

concurrentlyAll :: [IO a] -> IO [a]
concurrentlyAll :: [IO a] -> IO ()

concurrentlyAll = runConcurrently . foldr (<*>) (pure []) . map (Concurrently . (:))
concurrentlyAll_ = void . concurrentlyAll

OR

concurrentlyAll = mapConcurrently (>>= id)
concurrentlyAll_ = foldr (*>) (pure ()) . map Concurrently

OR

(best) --> concurrentlyAll = traverse Concurrently

FINAL:
  concurrently_ = void . traverse Concurrently

------------------------------------------
note to self:
  <*> = = (. (>>=)) . (>>=) = (. (>>=)) (. (>>=))
  x <*> y = join $ fmap (`fmap` y) x
  x <*> = join . (flip fmap x) . flip fmap
  <*> = (join .) . (. flip fmap) . flip fmap
